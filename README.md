This is an extremely small Java project I used to practice my Java skills before the AP Computer Science A exam.

## How to use

This program only works in the command line, so first you need to run the Main.java file:
- First you input the names of the individuals you would like to hurt and heal.
- All names start with 20 health.
- Then you follow this cycle:
  * The program will ask you who you would like to hurt, and who you would like to heal
  * The name hurt loses 2 health.
  * The name healed gains 1 health.
  * If a name reaches 0 health, they are removed from the pool of names eligible to be hurt or healed.
* This cycle repeats until there is only 1 name remaining, which is declared the winner.
* The program then lists all of the names placements, ending the program.
